# Backlog

This document contains all annoyances I've felt with my current setup.
Instead of burning work hours solving for a poorly aligned symbol or bad
scrolling experience, I want to record all of them here, and tackle them the way
I would solve problems at work.

## Issues

### Bad Scrolling

- For some reason the scrolling on neovim seems to be really bad
- I would like native scrolling on `tmux` inside neovim

### Checkbox symbol misaligned

- The checkbox symbols are not aligned in JetBrains font. Need to figure out why

### Finding TODOs

- After the upgrade away from telescope this functionality appears to be broken

## Configuration

### Ghostty support on remote hosts

- How do I make sure the `terminfo` is correctly populated

### Code block vs inline

- I want `inline` code to be gruvbox orange instead of green

## Features

### Work notes

- As a user, I would like a shortcut to open my modal work notes quickly
- As a user, I would like to have a shortcut to open a git-commit style message
  - When complete, I want it to go to the right section of my weekly summary
    with the timestamp

### Neovide

- There is some issue with the clipboard
- copy-paste
- colors are still weird
