/**
 * Extension loaded into sub-agents.
 * - Shows agent identity + available tools as a styled widget above the editor (toggle with Ctrl+Alt+O)
 * - Provides an `ask_question` tool for asking the parent orchestrator a question
 *
 * Subagents do NOT self-terminate via a tool. Auto-exit agents shut down
 * automatically when their agent loop ends (see the `agent_end` handler);
 * interactive agents end when the human exits their session.
 *
 * `ask_question` keeps the session OPEN: it writes a `${sessionFile}.ask`
 * signal the parent's watcher picks up, parks the session in a "waiting" state
 * (auto-exit is suppressed for that turn via `awaitingAnswer`), and the parent
 * replies with subagent_message — which lands as the subagent's next turn.
